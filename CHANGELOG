- The track list serves as dnd source for the upcoming version
  of Burn.
- Added an online help for use with Nicolas Roard's HelpViewer.

  in AudioCD.bundle. That makes the whole app more responsive
  and relieves users of the bundle from having to do the
  polling themselves.

  would be set to "01 00:00" before the actual status appeared.

  CD. It will take the first one it can find.
- The device list can be configured using Preferences.app.
