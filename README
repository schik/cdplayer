CDPlayer.app
============

Introduction
------------
CDPlayer is a small CD Audio Player for GNUstep. This application is
only tested on Linux/GNUstep.

This application is GPL'ed. Read the COPYING file.
All bugs reports should be sent to Andreas Schik <andreas@schik.de>.


How to build CDPlayer.app
-------------------------
o You must install libcdio, libcdio_cdda and libcdio_paranoia first. These
  libraries are needed for reading the CDDA data.

o As CDPlayer uses Cynthiune's output bundles to make the CD audible, you must
  install Cynthiune before you can build CDPlayer.

o Also Required is Cddb.bundle by Yen-Ju Chen. This bundle is included with
  CDPlayer and built automatically. See below for details.

o To build CDPlayer simply do the following:
	make
  This will build CDPlayer and the AudioCD and Cddb bundles.

o To install CDPlayer in your global GNUstep directory do:
	make install

  This will install CDPlayer in $(GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT)/Applications and the
  AudioCD and Cddb bundles in $(GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT)/Library/Bundles.
  The AudioCD bundle does all the audio CD handling.


GNUstep system
--------------
o CDPlayer 0.6.0 has been tested on GNU/Linux using the following versions
  of GNUstep:

gnustep-make	1.21
gnustep-base	1.21
gnustep-gui	0.19
gnustep-back	0.19


Cynthiune
---------
CDPlayer has been developed and tested against Cynthiune 1.0.0.
Cynthiune is part of GAP, which can be found here:

http://gap.nongnu.org/

CDDB/FreeDB suport
------------------
CDPlayer uses the Cddb bundle from Yen-Ju Chen
(http://www.people.virginia.edu/~yc2w/GNUstep/english/) to access FreeDB
databases. Cddb is integrated with CDPlayer and will automatically
be built and installed.

The original Cddb bundle project is available here:

Running
-------

CDPlayer.app uses its own preferences key 'Device' to pass as custom device to
the AudioCD bundle.

% openapp CDPlayer.app [--Device=<path_to_cd_device>]

If no device is given, AudioCD.bundle will poll all devices for audio CDs. It will
play the first on, it can find.
